# Program Description

The program uses a provided Backus-Naur Form (BNF) expression to construct an expression tree from a numeric expression that conforms to the BNF specification.

## Directions

     1. Executing the program will prompt the user for a binary tree visualization option. 
        Enter the number one (1) for a basic or compact representation of the binary tree. This works well for larger binary trees. 
        Enter the number one (2) for a more enhanced representation. 
     2. Once an option is sucessfully selected, the program will prompt the user for a valid expression that follows the 
        BNF displayed. Enter a valid expression and press enter.
     3. The result will display along with a respresentation of the expression tree abiding to the visualization option that was selected. 
 
 An example of each representation are as follows,

 Expression: 7 * {2 - 1} + 3 / {4 + 2}
